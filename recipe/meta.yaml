  summary: A python remote communications library
  description: |
    kiwipy is a library that makes remote messaging using RabbitMQ (and any
    other protocol for which a backend is written) EASY. I don't know about
    you but I find RabbitMQ HARD. It's all too easy to make a configuration
    mistake which is then difficult to debug. With kiwipy, there's none of
    this, just messaging, made simple, with all the nice properties and
    guarantees of AMQP.
